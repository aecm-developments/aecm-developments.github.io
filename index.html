Hello, I am Amanda Moore, a <i>Biology Researcher</i> at the <b>University of Pittsburgh</b>. I received my M.S. in Biology from Chatham University
  and my B.S. in Biology: Molecular Biotechnology (Honors Program) from Mount Aloysius College. During my graduate program, I worked on 
  how metabolism affects Alzheimer's disease.

My research interests are primarily in the areas of <i>Genetics</i> and <i>Neuroscience</i>. I have 5 years of wet lab experience
  in bacterial, fungal, and human cell culturing methods along with technical processing methods including DNA, RNA, and protein detection.
  I also have experience in data analysis with R and Python and understanding of HTML and CSS.
