# Jekyll Starter ¬∑ Chirpy Theme

A simple static website powered by [Jekyll‚Äëtheme‚ÄëChirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy), maintained by GitHub users **JacobGitz** and **aecm-developments**. This is a lightweight fork of the offical jekyll-theme-chirpy, pre‚Äëconfigured for ‚Äúadmin‚Äëonly‚Äù tasks (posting, basic layout) without the full blog setup. There is jekyll-starter, which is what this is based upon, refer to that repo (it is hosted by the same person who made jekyll-theme-chirpy).

## Installation

I simply forked this repo and edited it inside of github (not ideal, but it worked). If you are unlike me, and would like to git-clone this, it would probably be more ideal. There are instructions in the jekyll-starter for cloning, bundling, and serving jekyll pages locally so you can see them 'real time' as you edit your locally installed version on your machine. Github has an ~5-10 minute delay between the website being built via github pages and actually seeing those edits reflected on your website, which is obviously less than ideal if you are wanting to code a bit faster. I won't include those instructions here, but if you would like to do so, I suggest reading up on the docs and asking ChatGPT. If you are unfamiliar with github pages, github pages is a way of creating entirely free websites like this utilizing github, by simply turning a repo into a hosted website. You can refer to github's website on github pages for more info, as well as how jekyll works for quickly creating static websites.
